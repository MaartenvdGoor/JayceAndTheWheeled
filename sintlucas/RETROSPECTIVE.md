Have a discussion with all team members about the following topics:

* If you could go back in time and do this sprint again, what would you change and what wouldn't you change?
* What about this sprint was the biggest source of stress or difficulty for you personally?
* How did you cope with things that went wrong?
* What was the effect of earlier retrospectives?
* Are there aspects of our team culture that can be improved?
