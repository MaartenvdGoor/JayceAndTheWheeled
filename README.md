# Multidisciplinary project (SD3 - P12 - 2023/2024)
* You will work on a project in a multidisciplinary team. 
* Besides developers, there are also designers and other roles in the team.

## Collect proof of work in the 'sintlucas' folder
* Any document you create (PROPOSAL.md, REVIEW.md, RETROSPECTIVE.md and any other document)
* Make screenshots of your scrum board during stand-ups (before and after).
* Make screenshots of (parts of) the working application.
* Make screenshots of tests you did and the changes you made afterwards.
* Notes of meetings.
* Drawings of wireframes.
* Technical designs.
* Diagrams (architecture, database, class, ...).
* User Interface designs.
* ...

## General planning

## Phases of the project
Make sure you loop through these phases during the project:

### Proposal + MoSCoW
* With all team members you wrote a proposal based on the concept.
* In that proposal you described the problem you want to solve.
* You described the requirements of the product as user stories (As a ... I want ... so that ...).
* The next step is to prioritize the backlog items with the MoSCoW method.
* Make sure you add the proposal to the `sintlucas` folder as `PROPOSAL.md`.

### Design: game (if applicable)
A Game Design Document
* Visualizations
* Mechanics
* Dynamics
* Aesthetics

### Design: website, (web) application, VR/AR application, physical computing (if applicable)
A technical design, think of:
* What stack/frameworks will you use (HTML/CSS/JS, Vue, etc.)?
* Diagrams of the architecture of the application:
 * How will the parts work together (front-end/back-end/database/webservice/...)?
 * What data does your application need and how you will you store it?
* Database diagram:
 * What data does your application need and how you will you store it (REST webservice/database/SessionStorage api/...)?
* Class diagram:
 * What classes will you use and how will they interact? 
* What hardware do you need?
* What parts does your application consist of?
* Are there any security risks and how will you deal with them?
* How important is the performance?
* How will you deploy it?
* How will you test it?
* ...

A User Interface design, think of:
* Draw (paper or digital) a wireframe.
* Write a style guide with more info about fonts, colors, logo etc.
* ...

### Prepare for development
  * Create a scrum board in `GitHub Projects` or use a physical scrum board with these columns:
    sprint backlog (ToDo), in progress, testing, done
  * Place the user stories in `GitHub Issues` (which will act as your backlog) or use memos on you physical scrum board.
  * Have a sprint planning:
    * In this meeting you need to refine each user story (issue) into smaller, more technical items.
      Each item should be clear enough that it can be realised without further discussion.
    * Prioritize the backlog items if necessary.
    * Then estimate which items you can do in the first sprint (in this project a sprint takes 1 week).
    * Move them to the sprint backlog column on the scrum board.

### Realise: development
* Have a stand-up meeting every time you meet:
  * Use the scrum board
  * Every team member answers these questions:
    * What did you do last time?
    * What will you do today?
    * Are there any impediments in your way?
* Start developing on the sprint backlog items (ToDo).

Don't forget when you are developing software:
* Pull the changes of your team members regularly.
* Commit and push your changes regularly to prevent merge conflicts.
* Check the result in the browser regularly.
* Make sure that your code is readable and has comments.
* Make sure that your code follows coding guidelines

### Test: bugfixing
* Test every backlog item.
* e.g. Let end users test the product.
* e.g. Test your code in different browsers and on different devices.
* e.g. Test the result for speed by using the LightHouse tool in the browser's Developer Tools.

### Present/Discuss: review
* Target audience: client and other stakeholders
* Show the scrum board.
* Walk through its sprint backlog (ToDo) and show the result of each item.
* Write down the feedback you get from the client in `REVIEW.md`.
* Add/change items to the backlog (issues) based on the feedback in `REVIEW.md`.

### Reflect: retrospective
When you finished a sprint, you need to reflect on the process to improve it.
This is called a retrospective.
Use the template in the `RETROSPECTIVE.md` file to write down the results of the retrospectives.

**Go back to the preparation phase!**


### Final presentation
* Presentations skills are part of the exam
* Presentation target audience: teachers
* Demo of the product.
* Each person highlights his/her contribution to the project
* Detailed questions about the code will be asked.

### Final reflection
* After the presentation you will reflect on the project and your strong and weak points.
* Prepare yourself for this reflection.
* Questions will be asked.

## Feedback and feedforward
* During development, you will have reviews and retrospectives with one of the teachers.
* The teacher will evaluate your work (see file `SD - Feedback en feedforward door docent` in the `sintlucas` folder).
